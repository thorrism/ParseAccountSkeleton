# ParseAccountSkeleton
My repository for setting up the base components to an app using Parse. It serves as a bare bones starter application for when wanting to create a new app using Parse. Open to the public for use by anyone who might be interested 


#Currently supports:#

-Splash screen with brief icon for branding

-Start screen, user can login or sign up

-Sign up account, can be configured to include email

-Login account for users who have existing account

Just simply modify the ParseApplication file to use your Parse credientals after creating your account.
